I first met my wife when I was just 10 years old, back in elementary school. She was the new transfer student in our class, and from the moment I saw her, it felt like my soul had found its match. We quickly became best friends. Like a story straight out of a teenage romance, our friendship blossomed into something deeper. She was my first and true love.

After college, fate brought us together again during a trip to Japan. It was there that we reaffirmed what we had always known in our hearts: we were meant to be. On March 3rd, 2022, in the beautiful city hall of San Francisco, CA, we officially became a couple, sealing our bond in a way that felt nothing short of sacred.

Now, we’re building a life filled with love and joy in the serene town of Iowa City, where she’s chasing her dreams and fighting for her doctorate. Every day together is a sweeter chapter in the story we’ve been writing. ❤️
